# Lab 12 : 
# tool for numerical integration from SciPy  
from scipy.integrate import simps

#Import the constant for the speed of light
from astropy.constants import c


# 
# # Part 1 :  Look Back Time
# 
# A) 
# 
# Complete the function ``LookBackTime`` that takes as inputs the desired redshift and returns the corresponding time (Gyr ago). To do this, we need to Numerically integrate :
# 
# 
# $ t_L = \int_0^z \frac{dz'}{(1+z') H(z')}$
# 
# 
# The scipy function ``simps`` is really useful for numerical integration. At the start of the program I have 
# imported this module:  ``from scipy.integrate import simps`` 
# 
# 
# To use it, I have already defined an array with redshifts, spaced in intervals of 0.001
#     
# ``zrange = np.arange(zo, ze, 1e-3)``
# 
# Where zo is the redshift of the observer (it's us, so zo= 0).  And ze is the redshift of the emitter. 
# 
# Next define the integrand and utilize simps to integrate:
# 
# ``simps(y(x), x)``
# 
# 
# B) 
# 
# - How many Gyr ago was z = 1 in the benchmark cosmology? 
# - What is the age of the universe in the benchmark cosmology?  Use a large z value to estimate this. 
# - What is the age in the Einstein De Sitter cosmology (where $\Omega_m=1$ and all other density parameters are 0) ? 
# - Which cosmology results in the youngest age for the universe? 
# 
# 
# C) 
# 
# Complete the plot template for Look Back Time as a function of 1+ z for both the benchmark and Einstein De Sitter cosmologies. You will need loop over the ``LookBackTime`` function  from z = (0, 50) using a list comprehension. Follow the instructions in the template. 
# 

# # Part 2:  Comoving and Proper Distance
# 
# 
# A)
# 
# Complete the Method  ``ComovingDistance`` that takes as input: the redshift when the photon was observed and the redshift when the photon was emitted.  The function returns the Comoving Radial Distance from an observer at z=z_o, $D_C(z)$, by numerically integrating the following: 
# 
# $D_C(z) = c \int_{z_0}^{z_e} \frac{dz'}{H(z)}$
# 
# Where $c$ is the speed of light.  If $z_0$=0, $D_C(0)$ is equivalent to the proper distance to that object today (line of sight distance).
#  
#  D) 
# 
# Complete the Method ``ProperDistance`` that takes as input the the redshift when the photon was observed and emitted and returns the Proper Distance at that observed redshift.  I.e. it computes:
# 
# $\frac{D_C(z)}{(1+z_0)}$  
# 
# If $z_0$=0 this function returns the same value as the `ComovingDistance` function.
# 
#  
#  
# C)
# - What is the size of the observable universe in the Benchmark cosmology today?  (use a large redshift) 
# - What is the size in the Einstein De Sitter cosmology?  Which is smaller? 
# 
# 
# D)
# 
# What is the radial distance between two galaxies that are closely located on the sky, where one is at z=0.01 and the second galaxy is at z =0.05 ?  Compute this for today and also for an observer at z=0.01
# 
# 
# E) 
# 
# What is the size of the observable universe at z=2 ? 
# 
# F) 
# 
# Plot the Horizon Distance as a Function of Redshift out to z=10 for the BenchMark and Einstein DeSitter Cosmology
# 
# 
# 

# # Part 3:  Luminosity Distance
# 
# Determining distances to standard candles
# 
# 
# A)
# 
# Complete the function ``LuminosityDistance`` that takes as input the emitted redshift and returns
# 
# $D_L = D_C(1+z)$
# 
# B)
# 
# Consider a Type 1A  Supernova (absolute magnitude M = -19.3 $\pm$ 0.3) that goes off at an unknown redshift.  We measure an apparent magnitude m = 25.1. 
# 
# - What is the inferred Luminosity Distance ($D_{LSne}$) ? 
# 
# 
# $m-M = 5 Log(D_{LSne}/{\rm Mpc})  + 25  \qquad  D_{LSne} =  10^{(m - M - 25)/5}$
# 
# 
# -  Using the function ``LuminosityDistance``, what redshift most closely returns the inferred $D_{LSne}$?
# 
# -  Using the function ``ProperDistance``, what is the proper distance from an observer on earth to the supernova? 
# (note you could equivalently use the function ``ComovingDistance``)
# 

# # Part 4 : Angular Diameter Distance
# 
# 
# Translating angular separations into projected distances. 
# 
# A)
# 
# Complete the function ``AngularDiameterDistance``, which takes as input the desired redshift and returns
# 
# $D_A = D_C/(1+z)$. 
# 
# B)
# 
# Complete the function ``Size``, which takes as input the desired redshift and angle (assumed to be in arcsec) that is the size of an object, or size of the angle between two galaxies, and returns the true projected separation. 
# 
# 
# $\theta = \frac{D_{\rm sep}}{D_A}$
# 
# 
# C) 
# 
# Consider two galaxies that are located at an average redshift of 1.0 and separated by an angle of 1''.  What is their physical separation in kpc ?
